# Crushing Bugs

In this project, I am addressing two primary issues with our drag-and-drop puzzle game. The first issue involves restricting each drop zone to only one puzzle piece, as opposed to allowing multiple pieces. The second task is to ensure that pieces are properly cleared from the drop zones when the game is reset or when a new puzzle is selected, to maintain a clean starting point for gameplay.
